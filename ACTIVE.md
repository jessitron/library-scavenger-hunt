# what we are working on building

I want to make a simple static website. It is a landing page for an
event. The event is a scavenger hunt at the library.

We will publish this site on github pages.

## Outline

- Brief tagline or hook: Find your greatest treasure: knowledge!

Hero Section

- Eye-catching image or illustration: placeholder image for now
- Main call-to-action button (Register/Sign Up): Get a Clue Sheet (links to "get started" section)
- Key event highlights (prizes, duration, etc.): Charming prizes for all participants!

Event Details
